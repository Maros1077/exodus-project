# Exodus project

The Exodus project was born out of a desire to learn and experiment with technologies in a real-world scenario. I created it to learn more about microservices, Java Spring applications, databases, dockerization, RESTful APIs, and much more.

## Parts/Components

| Part/Component | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JSend library | [GitHub](https://github.com/Maros1077/exodus-jsend-network) | Network library shared across multiple components |
| IAM | [GitHub](https://github.com/Maros1077/exodus-iam) | Identity Access Management microservice |
| STS | TODO | Secure Token Service - work in progress |

## Want to contribute?
Feel free to contribute to any part of the project. Note, that I am not a developer (especially not for Java Spring apps) and I am working with a lot of technologies for the first time (that is the main reason for this project, right?), so I would appreciate also any form of feedback.
